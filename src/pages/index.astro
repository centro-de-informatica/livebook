        Successful typography requires you to pay attention to the whole, not just the parts. 
        These maxims summarize the key principles I keep in mind when laying out a document.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Body Text First</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Decide first how the body text will look. Why? Because there is more body text than 
        anything else. Four decisions&#8212;point size, line length, line spacing, and 
        font&#8212;largely determine the appearance of the body text. Therefore, these 
        decisions have the biggest influence on the legibility of the text and the overall 
        appearance of the document.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The optimal line length is between 45&#8211;90 characters, including spaces. This 
        might seem narrow, but studies have shown that longer lines make it harder to track 
        from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. The result is fatigue and 
        frustration for your reader.
      </Paragraph>

      <Figure caption="The Gutenberg Bible (1455) demonstrates timeless typographic principles that remain relevant today.">

          style={{ maxWidth: "100%", height: "auto", display: "block" }}
        />
      </Figure>

      <Paragraph>
        For images and diagrams that benefit from additional space, use the wide variant. 
        On large screens, it extends beyond the main content area:
      </Paragraph>

      <Figure wide caption="A wide figure that extends to the full available width on large screens, providing more detail for complex diagrams or imagery.">

          alt="Wide figure demonstration"
          style={{ maxWidth: "100%", height: "auto", display: "block" }}
        />
      </Figure>

      <Heading level={2}>Line Spacing</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Line spacing is the vertical distance between lines of text. The traditional term 
        is <em>leading</em> (rhymes with <em>bedding</em>), so named because traditional 
        print shops put strips of lead between lines of type to increase vertical space.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        For most text, the optimal line spacing is between 120% and 145% of the point size. 
        Most word processors, as well as <Abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</Abbr>, let you define line spacing as 
        a multiple. Or you can do the math&#8212;multiply your point size by the percentage.
      </Paragraph>

      <Blockquote cite="Practical Typography">
        <Paragraph>
          Single-spaced typewritten text is dense and hard to read. But double-spacing is 
          still looser than optimal. Find the sweet spot that gives your text room to 
          breathe without wasting vertical space.
        </Paragraph>
      </Blockquote>

      <Heading level={2}>First-Line Indents</Heading>

      <Aside>
        The terms <strong>uppercase</strong> and <strong>lowercase</strong> come from 
        traditional print shops. Capital letters, used less frequently, were stored in 
        a case on a shelf above the other letters (then called <em>minuscule</em> letters).
      </Aside>

      <Paragraph>
        A first-line indent is the most common way to signal the start of a new paragraph. 
        The other common way is with space between paragraphs. First-line indents and space 
        between paragraphs have the same relationship as belts and suspenders. You only 
        need one to get the job done. Using both is a mistake.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Typically, a first-line indent should be no smaller than the current point size, 
        or else it will be hard to notice. It should be no bigger than four times the 
        point size, or else the first line will seem disconnected from the left edge.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Page Margins</Heading>

      <Aside>
        If I have to work on a document from an outside source, one of the first things 
        I do is display white-space characters, to reveal lurking horrors.
      </Aside>

      <Paragraph>
        Page margins set the default territory your text occupies on the page. Because 
        they determine the maximum width of the text block, page margins have the greatest 
        effect on line length. Most word processors default to page margins of one inch. 
        On standard 8.5&#8221; &#215; 11&#8221; paper, that produces a line length of 
        6.5&#8221;. That was fine for the monospaced fonts of the typewriter era, which 
        used a lot of horizontal space. But for proportional fonts, they&#8217;re too small.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Professional typographers never use 8.5&#8221; &#215; 11&#8221; paper with a 
        6.5&#8221; line length. Neither should you. Whether you&#8217;re writing for 
        print or the web, set your text according to the principles of good typography. 
        The white space will take care of itself.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Small Caps and Abbreviations</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        When using acronyms like <Abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</Abbr>, 
        <Abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</Abbr>, or <Abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</Abbr>, 
        consider using small caps for a more refined appearance. Small caps require 
        letterspacing&#8212;about 5% to 10%&#8212;to look their best.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        You can also use <SmallCaps>small caps</SmallCaps> for emphasis in running text, 
        though this should be done sparingly. The key is that small caps blend better 
        with lowercase text than full capitals, which can appear to <SmallCaps>shout</SmallCaps> at 
        the reader.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Foreground and Background</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Divide the page into foreground and background. The foreground contains the most 
        important page elements. (Hint: the body text is usually one of them.) The 
        background contains everything else. Do not let the background elements upstage 
        the foreground elements.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Remember that you have a limited number of tools for making distinctions: position, 
        size, font, and sometimes color. Use them wisely and sparingly. Every visual 
        distinction you add creates noise; make sure each one earns its place.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Justified Text</Heading>

      <Aside position="right">
        Exceptions exist. For comprehensive explanations, consult <em>Garner&#8217;s 
        Modern English Usage</em> (see <SmallCaps>bibliography</SmallCaps>), the authority 
        on how to use semicolons, colons, other punctuation marks, and the rest of the 
        English language.
      </Aside>

      <Paragraph>
        Justified text is spaced so the left and right sides of the text block both have 
        a clean edge. The usual alternative to justified text is left-aligned text, which 
        has a straight left edge and an uneven right edge. Compared to left-aligned text, 
        justification gives text a cleaner, more formal look.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        If you are using justified text, you must also turn on hyphenation to prevent 
        gruesomely large spaces between words. Justification is a matter of personal 
        preference. It is not a signifier of professional typography.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Block Quotations</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Formatting block quotations is not hard. Reduce the point size and line spacing 
        slightly. Indent the text block between half an inch and a full inch on the left 
        side, and optionally the same on the right. Or on the web, about 2&#8211;5 ems. 
        Do not put quotation marks at the ends. They are redundant.
      </Paragraph>

      <Blockquote cite="Matthew Butterick, Practical Typography">
        <Paragraph>
          Block quotations are sometimes unavoidable. It may be that accuracy demands 
          extensive quoting. But as a means of textual emphasis, block quotations 
          sometimes become, like all caps, a form of self-defeating typography.
        </Paragraph>
      </Blockquote>

      <Heading level={2}>Code and Preformatted Text</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        When displaying code, use a monospaced font at a slightly reduced size. Inline 
        code like <InlineCode>font-family</InlineCode> or <InlineCode>line-height</InlineCode> should 
        have a subtle background to distinguish it from surrounding text.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        For longer code blocks, use proper indentation and maintain consistent spacing:
      </Paragraph>

      <CodeEditorBlock
        client:only="react"
        initialValue={`:root {
  --pt-font-serif: "Source Serif 4", Georgia, serif;
  --pt-font-sans: "Source Sans 3", Helvetica, sans-serif;
  --pt-line-height: 1.4;
  --pt-indent: 1.5em;
}`}
        language="css"
        theme="oneDark"
        lineNumbers={true}
        readOnly={true}
        height="180px"
      />

      <Paragraph>
        The code block above demonstrates how to set up <Abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</Abbr> custom 
        properties for a typography system. Notice the left border that visually connects 
        it to block quotations.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        For more complex code examples that benefit from additional width, use the wide 
        variant. On large screens, it expands to occupy the full available space:
      </Paragraph>

      <CodeEditorBlock
        client:only="react"
        initialValue={`/* Responsive typography system with fluid scaling */
@media (min-width: 75em) {
  .pt-article-header {
    position: absolute;
    left: calc(-1 * var(--pt-aside-width) - var(--pt-aside-gap));
    width: var(--pt-aside-width);
    text-align: right;
  }
  
  .pt-aside--left {
    left: calc(-1 * var(--pt-aside-width) - var(--pt-aside-gap));
    text-align: right;
  }
  
  .pt-aside--right {
    right: calc(-1 * var(--pt-aside-width) - var(--pt-aside-gap));
    text-align: left;
  }
}`}
        language="css"
        theme="oneDark"
        lineNumbers={true}
        readOnly={true}
        wide={true}
        height="380px"
      />

      <Heading level={2}>Bulleted and Numbered Lists</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Are you still making bulleted and numbered lists by manually typing bullets or 
        numbers at the beginning of each line? In the 21st century, no one should be 
        doing this task by hand. Manually formatted lists are a waste of time and prone 
        to error. Use automated lists.
      </Paragraph>

      <List type="unordered">
        <ListItem>Lists should be used sparingly in body text</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Hollow bullets are often preferred over solid bullets</ListItem>
        <ListItem>The indent should be noticeable but not excessive</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Consistent formatting throughout is essential</ListItem>
      </List>

      <Paragraph>
        As I suggested in mixing fonts, it is acceptable to set a list index (a bullet 
        or a number) in a different font than the list item itself. You can also make 
        the list index a smaller point size.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Tables</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Tables are one of the handiest tools in your word processor and web browser. A 
        table is usually the right solution for layout problems where white-space 
        characters are not up to the task. There are many ways to format a table. But 
        default tables have two formatting defects you should always fix: cell borders 
        and cell margins.
      </Paragraph>

      <Table>
        <TableHead>
          <TableRow>
            <TableCell header>Attribute</TableCell>
            <TableCell header>Athos</TableCell>
            <TableCell header>Porthos</TableCell>
            <TableCell header>Aramis</TableCell>
          </TableRow>
        </TableHead>
        <TableBody>
          <TableRow>
            <TableCell>Phone</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(617) 555-1453</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(508) 555-3232</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(603) 555-8490</TableCell>
          </TableRow>
          <TableRow>
            <TableCell>Cell</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(617) 555-3145</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(508) 555-2323</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(603) 555-8491</TableCell>
          </TableRow>
          <TableRow>
            <TableCell>Fax</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(617) 555-5413</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(508) 555-4545</TableCell>
            <TableCell>(603) 555-8492</TableCell>
          </TableRow>
        </TableBody>
      </Table>

      <Paragraph>
        Cell borders can make the grid cluttered and difficult to read, especially in 
        tables with many small cells. The text in the cells will create an implied grid. 
        When you are ready to format your table, I recommend turning off all the cell 
        borders to start, and then turning them back on as needed.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Rules and Borders</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        In traditional printing terminology, a rule is a line; a border is a box. Like 
        centered text, bold or italic, and all caps, rules and borders are best used 
        sparingly. Ask yourself: do you really need a rule or border to make a visual 
        distinction?
      </Paragraph>

      <Rule />

      <Paragraph>
        You can usually get equally good results by increasing the space above and below 
        the text. Try that first. For borders, set the thickness between half a point 
        and one point. Thinner borders can work on professionally printed goods but are 
        too fine to reproduce well on an office printer or computer screen.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Responsive Design</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Responsive web design is a technique that allows web layouts to reflow to suit 
        the scale and dimensions of the user&#8217;s screen. In this way, rather than 
        trying to confect a one-size-fits-all layout, a web designer can specify changes 
        for small screens and large screens, and sizes in between.
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        The rules of good typography do not change with screen size. The edges of the 
        screen are not the end. Just the beginning. Start by considering line length, 
        because it is the hardest to manage in a responsive layout. Regardless of screen 
        width, the optimal line length is still 45&#8211;90 characters.
      </Paragraph>

      <Aside>
        <List type="unordered">
          <ListItem>
            The easiest way to maintain consistent line length is by scaling the point 
            size and element width at the same rate.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Use <InlineCode>max-width</InlineCode> in <Abbr>CSS</Abbr> to ensure that the line 
            length is bounded.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            Be careful tying mobile layouts to <Abbr>CSS</Abbr> media queries based 
            on pixel width.
          </ListItem>
        </List>
      </Aside>

      <Heading level={2}>Grids</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        A grid is a system of horizontal and vertical lines that can guide layout choices. 
        Grids have been part of page layout since the Gutenberg Bible. In moderation, 
        grids can be useful. But in the words of Dutch designer Wim Crouwel, 
        &#8220;The grid is like the lines on a football field. You can play a great game 
        in the grid or a lousy game.&#8221;
      </Paragraph>

      <Paragraph>
        Grids are helpful when they encourage consistency. They make it easier to relate 
        elements on the page to existing ones. But grids are not helpful when they create 
        a false sense of security. If you take ugly content and align it to a 
        grid&#8212;it is still ugly content.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>The Nine Maxims</Heading>

      <List type="ordered">
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Decide first how the body text will look.</strong> Because there is 
          more body text than anything else.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Divide the page into foreground and background.</strong> Do not let 
          background elements upstage foreground elements.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Make adjustments with the smallest visible increments.</strong> 
          Typography thrives on fine details.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>When in doubt, try it both ways.</strong> There is no substitute for 
          making samples of two options and getting a visual reaction.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Be consistent.</strong> Things that are the same should look the same. 
          Things that look different should actually be different.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Relate each new element to existing elements.</strong> The page becomes 
          more constrained with each new piece.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Keep it simple.</strong> If you think you need three colors and five 
          fonts, think again.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Imitate what you like.</strong> Learning to see what is good about 
          other examples of typography makes it easier to solve problems in your own 
          layouts.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          <strong>Do not fear white space.</strong> Work outward from the text, not 
          inward from the page edges. If the text looks good, the white space will 
          take care of itself.
        </ListItem>
      </List>

      <Rule sectionBreak />

      <Paragraph noIndent>
        These principles form the foundation of practical typography. They are not 
        arbitrary rules but time-tested guidelines that help create documents that are 
        both beautiful and readable. Good typography is ultimately about 
        respect&#8212;respect for your readers and for the craft of visual communication.
      </Paragraph>

      <Heading level={2}>Hand-Drawn Elements</Heading>

      <Paragraph>
        Sometimes a document benefits from a more relaxed, sketchy aesthetic. Hand-drawn 
        elements can add personality and visual interest without compromising readability. 
        These sketchy graphics are created using <InlineCode>rough.js</InlineCode>, a 
        library that renders primitives in a hand-drawn style.

        Lines and arrows can be used to connect ideas or draw attention to specific 
        elements. The sketchy style makes them feel less formal and more approachable.

        For more complex compositions, you can combine multiple rough elements into a 
        single custom sketch. This flexibility allows you to create diagrams, 
        illustrations, and visual aids that maintain a consistent hand-drawn aesthetic.

        While these sketchy elements should be used sparingly in formal documents, they 
        can be effective for presentations, educational materials, or any context where a 
        more casual tone is appropriate. The key is to use them purposefully, not as a 
        substitute for clear thinking and good design.

        Typography is a craft that balances form and function. Whether using precise 
        digital letterforms or hand-drawn sketches, the goal remains the same: to 
        communicate clearly and beautifully with your readers.
